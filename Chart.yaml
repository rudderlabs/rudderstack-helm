# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
version: 0.7.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application.
appVersion: 1.4.3

# WIP
# dependencies:
#   - name: nginx-ingress
#     version: ~1.6.0
#     repository: https://helm.nginx.com/stable
#     condition: (optional) A yaml path that resolves to a boolean, used for enabling/disabling charts (e.g. subchart1.enabled )
#     tags: # (optional)
#       - Tags can be used to group charts for enabling/disabling together
#     enabled: (optional) Enabled bool determines if chart should be loaded
#     import-values: # (optional)
#       - ImportValues holds the mapping of source values to parent key to be imported. Each item can be a string or pair of child/parent sublist items.
#     alias: (optional) Alias usable alias to be used for the chart. Useful when you have to add the same chart multiple times
#
# Note: The postgresql chart is included as a local subchart in charts/postgresql/
# When postgresql.enabled is false, you should remove or rename the charts/postgresql
# directory to prevent it from being deployed, or it will be deployed but not used.
